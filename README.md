<!-- Short Description  -->
Costs of calling in disc-winged bats


## General info

We measure energetic expenditure during acoustic signaling in Spix’s disc-winged bats (Thyroptera tricolor)

##Data
* [Data](https://github.com/morceglo/Energetics-of-vocal-communication-in-Thyroptera/blob/main/CostCalling_Thtr.XLSX)

## Analyses

* [Statistical analysis](https://github.com/morceglo/Energetics-of-vocal-communication-in-Thyroptera/blob/main/Energetics%20of%20calling%20in%20Thyroptera.R)
